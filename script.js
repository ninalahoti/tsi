These solutions, found through the synthesis of existing technology and research, focus on simplicity, ease-of-use, and accessibility throughout the design process while still minimizing overall cost and centering on convenience in an intuitive user experience. <br><br> Everyday issues are a proven source of stress, and research shows that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between life stress and illness. Many diagnoses require ongoing care or treatment entailing actions such as taking daily medication, monitoring vitals, doing physical therapy, and going to frequent doctors visits. While the aforementioned tasks may seem simple to perform, they often come with overlooked inconveniences that build up into acute stress over time. Due to the relationship between stress and illness, simplifying everyday actions common in treatment plans has strong potential to work as a preventative measure. <br><br> Current disability studies often focus on assistive technologies aiming to address issues specific to specified disabilities and diagnoses as these issues are commonly overlooked. Additionally, many design solutions focus more heavily on larger-scale issues or a conglomeration of issues to maximize impact. Due to the normalized nature of common treatment plan tasks, the stress that comes with these actions is ill acknowledged, and the simplification of actions like taking medication and monitoring vitals is not prioritized. Due to the large population performing these everyday tasks, reducing the stress around these actions has the potential to produce a large-scale impact despite these actions seeming relatively small-scale. <br><br> In order to simplify these tasks, one must deconstruct what simplicity actually entails. Modern design theory tends to associate simplicity with modernism and minimalism; however, this understanding of simplicity often lends itself to encouraging inaccessible design decisions especially when considering the many people who live with some form of cognitive disability. Rather than developing an explicit definition of simplicity, I propose focusing on specific aspects of simplicity to bring these characteristics to the forefront of my work. I put forward the following attributes as key areas of focus: ease-of-use, accessibility, and comfort. The connection between simplicity and ease-of-use is relatively clear; that which is intuitive to use is simple to use as the user does not have to perform as much mental work in order to make use of the product. The same justification can be extended to apply to accessibility seeing that more accessible products reduce barriers to successful product use. Common areas of accessibility, such as physical, visual, and cognitive, are key here, but other forms, such as financial, are salient as well. Optimizing accessibility promotes a standardized ease-of-use across the user population. The connection between simplicity and comfort is substantiated in quality of performance—research shows that higher levels of comfort yield higher levels of performance. This phenomenon is evident in a variety of realms such as in learning (thermal comfort in classrooms), in professional work (visual and environmental comfort in offices and workplaces), and in physical performance (lower limb comfort in athletes). By increasing performance, one increases ease-of-use, leading to an overall simpler user experience. Because there exists a well-supported negative correlation between comfort and stress in medical settings, in my process, I will pay particular attention to creating a comfortable experience.";

    mycontent.innerHTML = "Finding a task to simplify requires first identifying a task to improve. The story behind the creation of the artificial pancreas heavily informs my exploratory research process. For years, patients with with type I diabetes criticized the gap between glucose monitoring and insulin delivery. In 2014, members in the community realized that a specific insulin pump model had a  security flaw that made it possible to control the pump using a glucose monitor. The Open Artificial Pancreas System project, also known as #OpenAPS, was then born—this project shared the code and materials needed to create an artificial pancreas as well as intructions on how to do so online along with the hashtag #WeAreNotWaiting. The idea for an artificial pancreas—along with the technology needed in order to develop one—existed long before its creation. When designing for communities one does not belong to, one can easily overestimate the importance of a perceived issue; this exaggeration can often lead to ignorant design solutions for problems that do not really exist. To avoid this phenomenon, I aim to find pain points through conversations with members of my target audience in order to ensure that the problems I address are real and substantiated. From trends in these pain points, I will develop problem areas where I can explore concepts and eventual design solutions synthesizing existing technology while focusing on improvements related to my three key characteristics of simplicity.<br><br>In my initial exploration of smaller-scale issues within the medical realm, I focused my attention on Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Patients. POTS is a condition related to low blood volume when rising to an upright position and typically coexists with variety of other conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, joint hypermobility and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, autoimmunity, anxiety & hypervigilance, functional GI disorders, fibromyalgia, migraines, and concussions. I chose to focus on this community because patients diagnosed with POTS have a lower average quality of life, and because many symptoms are unexplained and oftentimes not caused by orthostatic intolerance, there is less research focused on improving quality of life because POTS research tends to focus more heavily on finding explanation. To understand more about the everyday experience of individuals diagnosed with POTS, I conducted two preliminary interviews in person, each lasting 30 minutes. Both of the interviewees were women in their early twenties; one was diagnosed in childhood, and one was diagnosed within the past few years. Because the majority of those diagnosed with POTS are young women, the limited demographic was acceptable for introductory research. The informal interviews consisted of open ended questions regarding treatment and daily life.<br><br>Insight into main pain points revealed problem areas of medication management and prediction and awareness of low blood pressure (lower blood pressure from low blood volume precedes POTS symptoms and often plays a role in coexisting conditions). This exploratory research pointed to problem areas that are not specific to POTS—on the contrary, taking medication and monitoring blood pressure are actions common to a large portion of the general population. With this revelation, I chose to expand my focus to the populations affected by these problem areas as the main pain points I heard within these problem areas were not POTS-specific. Examining the population that monitors blood pressure prompted me to consider the effects of continually monitoring multiple vitals. In past years, I volunteered over 500 hours at Memorial Hermann Children’s Hospital in Houston, Texas, and from this experience, I am acutely aware of how intimidating medical settings can feel. In my memory, a main stress factor for pediatric inpatients was monitoring vitals for a variety of reasons—the unnatural feeling of being attached to a machine, the lack of physical comfort in vitals-monitoring devices, and the difficulty that comes with walking while attached to these devices, for example. The adverse effects of current methods of monitoring vitals are well-founded and involve aspects of the inpatient experience such as sleep quality, emotional distress, and physical comfort. The connection between comfort and the inpatient experience with reference to monitoring vitals prompted me to expand my problem areas to include inpatient vitals monitoring.";
